            <p className="intro-text">A scale is a group notes that sound nice when used together and communicate a particular feeling. Scales form the foundation of melodic music. There are many types of scales with different combinations of notes. Different scales have different number of notes. Some have 5 notes, some 8 some 9 and so on.</p>

                Some examples include the major scale, minor scale, pentatonic scale, chromatic. There are many more examples that will not be mentioned in this course. We will focus on the most basic and most important: the major scale. The major scale is the most used scale and it is called major because it sounds happy. The major scale has 8 notes where the eighth note is a higher octave(repeatition) of the first so technicaly it has just 7 notes. The minor scale has 8 notes as well with the eighth note being the higher octave of the first. Note that even though these two scales have the same number of notes they differ in the specific combination of notes that make up the scales. These scales and many more will be covered in the lessons ahead. In the next section, we'll divert a litle and talk about our fingers and how we use them to play these notes.
