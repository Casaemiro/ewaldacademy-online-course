        <p className="intro-text">The major scale is the most used scale and it is called major because it sounds happy. The major scale has 8 notes where the eighth note is a higher octave(repeatition) of the first so technicaly it has just 7 notes. Recall that  there are 12 notes in western music. The major scale can be played beginning from any of the 12 notes giving us 12 different versions of the major scale. When it is played beginning from C, it is called the C-major scale, When begun fom F-sharp, it is called the F-sharp-major scale and so on. The first note of the major scale is called the key of the scale. In other words, Playing the major scale on the key on C means taking C as the first note of the scale. Now we know how to get the first note but how do we figure out the other 6 notes? thats where the major scale formular comes in.</p>
